# Quick Fix
In this project we make publisher subscriber method where a client requests for a service to the manager like plumber, electrician and carpenter by using java swing and design patterns.

# Case Study

Suppose you are part of a growing software house which is known for developing software for Uber-like
startups. The marketing guys recently engaged a client who is interested to take his business to the next level
by investing in a business information system. Below is the user story shared with the team:
I run a service company providing maintenance services to various organizations (e.g. banks,
hospitals, hotels etc.) in Mianwali. I have 13 full-time employees: a manager, an office
assistant, a workshop supervisor, 3 plumbers, 4 electricians, and 3 carpenters. When there are
more service requests, I hire maintenance staff on hourly rate. I want to have a software
system through which not only I can keep track of the expenses and sales, the manager can
assign responsibilities, monitor progress, define quotes, and manage other day to day tasks. I’d
like the system to be usable on a mobile so that my technical staff can remain in contact, post
progress and add task details. My office assistant receives calls from our clients, and schedules
maintenance job for them. I want clients to post their requests on the system, fix appointment,
and get estimated quote. The workshop supervisor keeps record of various tools and items,
issues them to the staff, and is responsible for keeping the inventory. He requests purchases to
the manager, who can approve demands up to Rs.10000. Beyond that, he needs my approval.
The systems must fully automate my business, HR and CRM processes. I’ve been running my
business quite successfully from past few years, maintaining most of the data in registers or
Excel spreadsheets. Since last year, I’m planning to launch another office in Talagang and/or
Khushab. If this software is deployed within next 6 months, I can offshoot next year.
My ambition is to be recognized as the founder of the top maintenance service provider in
Pakistan. So in the long run, I’ll be switching my business model since it can’t scale. I strongly
believe that a model similar to Uber has great potential, and I’m willing to invest in software
that can facilitate my goals.
